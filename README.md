# Asteroid - A Block-Based Programming Language

Asteroid is a custom-built, block-based programming language designed to simplify the process of coding by utilizing visual blocks for writing programs. It offers native support for complex data structures like dictionaries and lists, file and folder manipulation, and string processing. Asteroid is an open-source language focused on providing a simple yet powerful environment for educational purposes and introductory programming.

## Features

- **Block-Based Syntax**: Visual programming with blocks makes it easier for beginners to understand programming concepts.
- **Native Data Structures**: Supports lists and dictionaries for efficient data manipulation.
- **Database Integration** (in progress): Seamlessly interact with databases for storage and retrieval operations.
- **File and Folder Manipulation**: Read from and write to files, manage directories.
- **String Manipulation**: Tools for working with and modifying strings.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new features and functions to the language.
